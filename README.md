# gitpod-interactive-onboarding

An experiment to see whether we can leverage [CodeTour](https://github.com/microsoft/codetour) to streamline the process of configuring a project for [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io).

With the CodeTour extension installed in your VS Code, run the CodeTour: Open Tour URL... command and provide the raw URL to the `gitpod-onboarding.tour` file in this repository.
